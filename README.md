# b3orgtheme

JASMIN-branded Bootstrap v3 theme

## Installation

Although it can be installed as a django app, its intended use is to be
deployed to an artefacts server so that static assets can be pointed to by
the relevant `fwtheme-django` or `fwtheme-django-<orgname>`.

`b3orgtheme` can also be installed directly from Github using pip:

```
$ pip install git+https://git@github.com/cedadev/b3orgtheme.git
```
